# Add Color

Depending on your goals for your map, you may want to add color.  Your practice sheet is a good place to experiment before you work on your finished map.

Some cartographers choose a simple color palette, using just one or two colors, while others use many colors. The choice is yours.

Depending on the medium you choose for your color, you may want to test your colors with your pen ink to make sure the pen won't run. For example, colored pencils won't be an issue since they are applied dry, but markers or paints may cause pen ink to run if it's not permanent. If you want to apply wet colors, use a permanent ink. Or forego inking your map entirely and just use the colors.  Or use the colors and then apply the pen ink after the colors dry. There are many options. Try some test swatches on a separate sheet of paper and decide what you like.
