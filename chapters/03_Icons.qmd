# Icons

Before we start drawing our map, we need to plan how we will represent the items we include in our map and practice drawing them before we put them into the map. 

Let's make a list of the things we think we'll need to draw in our map of Lake Spafford:

 * Trees
 * Bridges
 * Pathways
 * Roads
 * Buildings
 * Grass
 * Field

On one of your sheets of paper, try drawing one or two versions of each of these things. Decide how much detail you need to include. Often simple is better for maps.  Think about how these items look either from above or at an oblique angle, depending on the goal of your map. Maybe you want to mix nadir and oblique perspectives, depending on the item.
