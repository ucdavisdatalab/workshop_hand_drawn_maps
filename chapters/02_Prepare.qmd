# Preparation

Before we can start drawing, we need to do a few steps to prepare:

## 1. Envision Your Map

What area do we plan to make a map of?  For the text and examples in this workshop, we'll make a map of Lake Spafford in the UC Davis Arboretum near Mrak Hall. You could choose any area you like.

How much area do we want to include (scale)? For this example, we'll keep it fairly limited - we'll just include Lake Spafford and the area immediately around it.

What is the goal of the map? What do we want the reader to learn from it? For this example, let's convey where Lake Spafford is situated, including the paths to get to there, buildings nearby, and the tree cover.

What is the perspective of your map? Are you looking straight down (nadir) or are you looking at an angle (oblique)?



## 2. Gather Reference Material

### Maps for Reference

Early cartographers often copied work from other finished maps.  We'll follow this tradition. For our map, it's fairly easy to use online maps like [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/). You could also reference the official online [UC Davis Campus Map](https://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/) or a printed version of it.  If you wanted to work on a version of this map that showed a historical point in time, you would want to reference older versions of the print campus map or aerial photographs. Some of these materials can be found in the [UC Davis Library's Map Collection](https://library.ucdavis.edu/archives-and-special-collections/our-collections/map-collection/).

### Icons & Style References

Collect some materials to help provide inspiration. These materials could be work you admire from other cartographers or artists, colors you like, or visual textures you might use.



## 3. Gather Drawing Materials

We'll need a few art supplies to get started:

 * 2 Sheets of Paper (printer paper or notebook paper is fine)
 * A pencil
 * An eraser
 * Pens (optional)
 * Coloring materials like colored pencils, markers, or crayons (optional)
 
If you don't have all of these things, just improvise. Remember that our goal is to learn a workflow and technique, not to be perfect.
