Notebook or printer paper and the pens and pencils you have on hand will be sufficient to get started. A large eraser is highly recommended.\nFor those with previous experience working in digital illustration software such as Inkscape, Illustrator, or other tools listed in the Additional Resources section, participants may choose to work in these tools rather than traditional pen and paper, but the workshop will not cover how to use these tools.",

For this example, we’ll keep it fairly limited - we’ll just include Lake Spafford and the area immediately around it.\nWhat is the goal of the map? What do we want the reader to learn from it? For this example, let’s convey where Lake Spafford is situated, including the paths to get to there, buildings nearby, and the tree cover.\nWhat is the perspective of your map?

We’ll follow this tradition. For our map, it’s fairly easy to use online maps like Google Maps. You could also reference the official online UC Davis Campus Map or a printed version of it. If you wanted to work on a version of this map that showed a historical point in time, you would want to reference older versions of the print campus map or aerial photographs. Some of these materials can be found in the UC Davis Library’s Map Collection.\n\n\n2.2.2 Icons & Style References\nCollect some materials to help provide inspiration. These materials could be work you admire from other cartographers or artists, colors you like, or visual textures you might use.\n\n\n\nA hand drawn cartoon map of Downtown Davis from 1985 featuring an oblique perspective of points of interest is available in the UC Davis Library’s Map Collection\n\n\n\n\n\nLandform examples drawn from an oblique perspective from Erwin Raisz’ Principles of Cartography\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Keane’s Family Circus comic often featured maps of Jeffy’s adventures and was featured in an NPR Article)",

Dixon’s Ticonderoga Black Pencils are worth the splurge ($6 for a pack of 12 vs. $3 for regular pencils) if you use wood pencils a lot. The graphite doesn’t have grit or rocks in it the way cheaper pencils do.\nEraser: Arch Foam Erasers don’t leave marks the way pink erasers can and they don’t tear up the page.\nPens: Pilot Precise Rolling Ball pens come in a couple of widths (0.5 and 0.7 mm), are consistent in their quality, and are easy to find. Uni-Ball makes similar pens. For thicker lines, PaperMate’s Flair pens are an affordable choice.\nPaper: A good quality sketch pad is helpful when you’re ready to make art that you want to keep because the pages won’t warp with the moisture in your hand and the paper can be archival quality.",

We will need to ink our features in a different order than we drew them.\nFirst, ink the text - this has priority over everything else so ink this first and edit the other features around it. Because pens tend to make a wider mark than a pencil, you may find that your text expands to be larger than your pencil labels. Consider practicing inking text over pencil on your practice sheet first to see how your text changes with the pen.\nSecond, ink the tallest to shortest features. Trees might go first because their canopies are above everything else. If a building is taller, do that first.\nLast, ink the things on the ground like roads and paths so that they can pass under the tall objects like the trees.\nWhen you’ve drawn over all the pencil, give the ink some time to dry, then gently erase your pencil marks. You may find your map now looks less busy and you may want to add more detail at this stage. Keep an eye out for features you forgot to ink as you erase and fill those in.",

Your practice sheet is a good place to experiment before you work on your finished map.\nSome cartographers choose a simple color palette, using just one or two colors, while others use many colors. The choice is yours.\nDepending on the medium you choose for your color, you may want to test your colors with your pen ink to make sure the pen won’t run. For example, colored pencils won’t be an issue since they are applied dry, but markers or paints may cause pen ink to run if it’s not permanent. If you want to apply wet colors, use a permanent ink. Or forego inking your map entirely and just use the colors. Or use the colors and then apply the pen ink after the colors dry. There are many options. Try some test swatches on a separate sheet of paper and decide what you like.",

Fancy a sea serpent?\nTitle: Include a title on your map. You could highlight it by placing the title in a decorative element like a banner.\nNorth Arrow: indicate the cardinal directions in your map with a north (or other direction) arrow. This is one place that has always been ripe with creative opportunity in map design.\nLegend: make sure your reader understands your symbols with an area dedicated to explaining each symbol.\nCartouche: a decorative container that holds text related to your map. Typically a cartouche contains the map’s title and the cartographer’s name, but it also may include additional information the cartographer wants to convey.",
