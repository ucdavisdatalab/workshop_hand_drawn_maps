Notebook or printer paper and the pens and pencils you have on hand will be sufficient to get started. A large eraser is highly recommended.\nFor those with previous experience working in digital illustration software such as Inkscape or Illustrator, participants may choose to work in these tools rather than traditional pen and paper, but the workshop will not cover how to use these tools.",

We are learning and we will expect that things may not go as we plan, but we’ll be open to the possibilities that we create as we work. Essentially, everything you do is correct.",

For this example, we’ll keep it fairly limited - we’ll just include Lake Spafford and the area immediately around it.\nWhat is the goal of the map? What do we want the reader to learn from it? For this example, let’s convey where Lake Spafford is situated, including the paths to get to there, buildings nearby, and the tree cover.\nWhat is the perspective of your map? Are you looking straight down (nadir) or are you looking at an angle (oblique)?",

We’ll follow this tradition. For our map, it’s fairly easy to use online maps like Google Maps. You could also reference the official online UC Davis Campus Map or a printed version of it. If you wanted to work on a version of this map that showed a historical point in time, you would want to reference older versions of the print campus map or aerial photographs. Some of these materials can be found in the UC Davis Library’s Map Collection.\n\n\n2.2.2 Icons & Style References\n\n\n\nLandform examples from Erwin Raisz’ Principles of Cartography\n\n\nCollect some materials to help provide inspiration.

We will need to ink our features in a different order than we drew them.\nFirst, ink the text - this has priority over everything else so ink this first and edit the other features around it. Because pens tend to make a wider mark than a pencil, you may find that your text expands to be larger than your pencil labels. Consider practicing inking text over pencil on your practice sheet first to see how your text changes with the pen.\nSecond, ink the tallest to shortest features. Trees might go first because their canopies are above everything else. If a building is taller, do that first.\nLast, ink the things on the ground like roads and paths so that they can pass under the tall objects like the trees.\nWhen you’ve drawn over all the pencil, give the ink some time to dry, then gently erase your pencil marks. You may find your map now looks less busy and you may want to add more detail at this stage. Keep an eye out for features you forgot to ink as you erase and fill those in.",
